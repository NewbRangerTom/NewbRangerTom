### Hi there 👋

<!--
**NewbRangerTom/NewbRangerTom** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
This Bio is a work in progress.
-->

I'm new to writing any kind of programming language.
I started with using the Arduino IDE. I have started using Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO and Visual Studio for my projects.
I prefer using the NodeMCU v2 for prototyping and testing my code. I also have Arduino UNO clones and D1 Mini’s.  As of late 2021, 
I have started using ESP32 dev boards.

I am using Visual Studio Code w/PlatformIO for wrting source code in C++, Python, and HTML/CSS.
I am using Jupyter Notebooks for data analytics.

Something more about me:

- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him/SSG (becasue we all need to be addressed by something).
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I was an Army Multi-Channel Communications Specialist for 20 years.  I retired as a Staff Sergeant.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I am a Scottish Lord by Proclamation.  Robert De Bruce, King of Scotland, was one of my great (21 gen's back) Uncle's.  I am a descendent of his brother Bernardus.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Embedded Systems, SQL/Database Management, and data analytics. 
- 👨‍🎓 My current eduction goals: I finished my AAS in Computer Information Technology in Dec 2021.  I started working on Bachelors level courses. (2022)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- --    1. RGB LED lights for Christmas decorations. (2022)
- --    2. Adding a button function to the ESP8266 Weather Station for selectable location ID's.
           
- 🔭 My repositories include two versions of a Towing Payload Calculator inspired by Ian @ Big Rock Media.  Ian created his calculator in Excel.
-   - The first is towCalc and is functional C++
-   - The second is OOPtowCalc and is my attempt at Object Oriented C++
-   - Update on this project: there was no interest in this so it died an un-noticed death sometime in 2021.

- 🤔 👯 I’m looking for help with and/or collaborate on...
-   - Any idea's to streamline my button sketch (The tidier the better for using with the Weather Station sketch).
-   - Suggestions on ways to improve the code in my OOPtowCalc (this is my first attempt at writting object oriented C++)
-   - Suggestions on ways to imrpove my towCalc code.
