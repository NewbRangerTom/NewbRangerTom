This Bio is a work in progress.  I edit this as time permits.

I'm new to writing any kind of programming code.  I started out with Arduino IDE and am starting to use Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO.
I prefer using the NodeMCU v2 for prototyping and testing my code but I have UNO clones and D1 Mini’s also. 

Here is something about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... Adding a button function to the ESP8266 Weather Station for selectable location ID's.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I'm working towards finishing my AAS in Computer Information Technology.
      I'll decide if I'm going to continue with the BA when I get to my final semester.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... If you have any idea's on how to streamline my button sketch feel free to let me know.
      The tidier the better for using with the Weather Station sketch.
